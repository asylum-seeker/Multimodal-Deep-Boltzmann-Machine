This is the structure of the code that implements the Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine :

* **config.py** a python configuration file that store the directory of the data and the directory to store the learned model.

* **rbm.py** a python class that implements an RBM. It supports the binary and gaussion type of RBMs. 
 I added to it another type, in order to include the Replicated Softmax Model of RBMs.

* **dbm.py** a python class that implements a Deep Boltzmann Machine. It is implemented as stacked RBMs. 

* **run_flickr_text_dbm.ipynb** is the python script that trains the text specific Deep Boltzmann Machine.  
  It outputs **text_dbm_layer_i_W.npy** and **text_dbm_layer_i_b.npy** for layer i. 

* **run flickr image dbm.ipynb** is the python script that trains the image specific Deep Boltzmann Machine. 
 It outputs **image_dbm_layer_i_W.npy** and **image_dbm_layer_i_b.npy** for layer i.

* **run_flickr_multimodal_dbm.ipynb** is the python script that implements the multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine using the weights learned from the two precedent scripts.


This files are my contribution to the code. To find the working code, you can go to the [Deep_Learning_Tensorflow](https://github.com/abyoussef/Deep-Learning-TensorFlow/) repository.
